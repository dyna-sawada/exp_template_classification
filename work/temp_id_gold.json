Imposing the death penalty is also the choice of society as a whole, which has historically supported this ultimate punishment, based on opinion polls. It is part of our justice system, and has been upheld by the Supreme Court, despite claims that the death penalty violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Thus, executions don't involve \"one person killing another\". They represent the carrying out of a sentence enacted to protect society. ",

As a society, we are constantly evolving.

Likewise, just as we no longer rely on fallible eyewitness accounts when determining guilt, we no longer execute criminals by gibbeting or bludgeoning.

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society.

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society.

Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society.

Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society.

Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room.

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands.

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Hello, everyone. Today’s topic is “Death penalty should be abolished”. We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

If one or both of the kidneys are damaged peoples are required to operate and cut off and replace the kidneys. Some times any human body part becomes infected by 'Cancer' and to save human life it is necessary to cut off that very part.

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice.

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report.

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

However, there is little evidence to suggest that any truly innocent persons have been put to death in recent times -- at least since the beginning of the 20th century in the US. When capital punishment sentences are overturned on appeal, the typical result is conversion to a life sentence. Only in the rarest cases does an appeal result in a death penalty case being reversed, with the conviction tossed out. Furthermore, in such cases, the reason is typically a lack of overwhelming evidence or a legal technicality; for instance, juror or prosecutorial misconduct may be cited. In other words, winning an appeal doesn't mean the accused was actually innocent. In order to get a death sentence, a unanimous jury decision is needed, along with strong proof such as DNA evidence. Thus, wrongful convictions of the innocent are very rare in capital punishment cases in modern times. ",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",

At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework.

I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers’ workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers’ workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents.

Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That’s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That’s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies.

In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents.

We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That’s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies.

In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents.

Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies.

In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents.

Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That’s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That’s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class.

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study.

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class.

We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is “harmful efforts” and the second point is “decreasing teacher’s burden”. Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",

We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is “harmful efforts” and the second point is “decreasing teacher’s burden”. Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is “harmful efforts” and the second point is “decreasing teacher’s burden”. Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study.

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study.

We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is “harmful efforts” and the second point is “decreasing teacher’s burden”. Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home.

In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary.

The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful.

        "speech": "Hello everyone. Today’s motion is “Homework should be abolished”. We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

        "speech": "Hello everyone. Today’s motion is “Homework should be abolished”. We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
