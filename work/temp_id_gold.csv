0,DP,2,11,"Hello everyone. Todayâ€™s topic is â€œDeath penalty should be abolishedâ€. I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. Itâ€™s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely â€œNoâ€. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. Itâ€™s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that because mistakes are human nature, the risk of misjudgment in death sentence cases is too great. However, this argument makes quite a leap in logic. We are exposed to risks due to human error in nearly every aspect of life, yet we accept those risks for the most part. The cost of human error is, admittedly, greater in some instances than others. But death penalty cases aren't alone in carrying a life-or-death risk. When we decide to travel by plane, for instance, we accept the potentially fatal risk of human error on the part of the pilot and air traffic controller. Likewise, a heart surgeon's built-in human error puts all of his patients' lives at risk. The best we can due is to minimize the risk of human error wherever we encounter it. In capital punishment cases, this means demanding effective legal counsel and unbiased juries, as an example.","[2, 3, 5]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

However, reducing the chances of mistakes of judgment in capital punishment should then be the goal. Instead of abandoning the death penalty, which is an effective tool of the criminal justice system, we should work to lower the incidence of mistaken judgment in such cases. One way to do this is to raise the bar for cases deemed suitable to warrant the death penalty. Another way is to increase the burden of proof needed for a conviction in a capital punishment case. Expanding the number of jurors and insisting on a unanimous juror verdict in death penalty case would also lower the odds of misjudgment. Likewise, juries should be better educated about applying the death penalty, and they should be protected from retribution and prohibited from profiting from their participation -- ensuring that jurors vote based on evidence only.","[2, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. Itâ€™s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely â€œNoâ€. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. Itâ€™s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that there is a risk of innocent people being executed, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, it is a myth that death row is filled with truly innocent individuals. The majority of death sentences end up being reduced on appeal. However, that certainly doesn't mean that the majority of those sentenced to death were innocent. Typically, sentences are reduced due to legal technicalities and due to issues unrelated to innocence such as jury tampering and prosecutorial misconduct. While death row cases do in fact account for a preponderance of exonerations, this doesn't mean each exonerated party was actually innocent. An exoneration might indicate a lack of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, for instance. Hence, it can't be argued that the danger of executing innocents is a valid reason to ban the death penalty.",[1],"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

There are a variety of legal issues that the convicted party can exploit in hopes of winning a lesser sentence or gaining release from prison.

If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. Itâ€™s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely â€œNoâ€. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. Itâ€™s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that because there is a chance of a mistake in a death penalty case, we must end capital punishment. However, this argument is a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Just because a tiny fraction of those executed may have been innocent doesn't mean the death penalty doesn't have more benefits than disadvantages. Instead of getting rid of the death penalty, we should be focused on eliminating the chance of error resulting in the execution of the truly innocent. One way this is already occurring is by increasingly relying on the strongest, most foolproof evidence: DNA left at the scene. Furthermore, video captured by security cameras is replacing eyewitness testimony, which has a greater chance of inaccuracy due to imperfect human memory. Another way mistakes can be reduced is by increasing use of all the legal avenues of redress, including the appeals process. Error reduction should be the focus rather than elimination of a penalty that protects society.","[2, 3, 4]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Being an executioner is part of a prison job, which is a voluntary position, meaning the person had to seek out the job. No one is being forced against their will to carry out a legal execution. So, the assumption of suffering and stress on the part of the executioner is unproven and probably exaggerated. For all we know, executioners feel relief and pride instead of stress when they perform a job intended to keep society safe and bring justice to victims.

115,DP,4,10,"Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is â€œRehabilitationâ€. The second point is â€œWorldâ€™s trendâ€. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.","They said that rehabilitation of criminals, not capital punishment, is what we should strive for. However, the idea of being able to transform a criminal into a contributing member of society is a lofty ideal. If it worked, and if we had evidence of its success, rehabilitation might be the ultimate goal of prison. However, we don't have a formula for how to rehabilitate prisoners whose criminal behavior has multiple and often unknown causes. And, even if we had such a formula, we still wouldn't have the vast resources to implement it. Rehabilitation requires a combination of measures, including academic education, vocational training, behavioral therapy, medication, and spiritual counseling.

First point is â€œRehabilitationâ€. The second point is â€œWorldâ€™s trendâ€. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.","They said that rehabilitation of criminals, not capital punishment, is what we should strive for. However, the idea of being able to transform a criminal into a contributing member of society is a lofty ideal. If it worked, and if we had evidence of its success, rehabilitation might be the ultimate goal of prison. However, we don't have a formula for how to rehabilitate prisoners whose criminal behavior has multiple and often unknown causes. And, even if we had such a formula, we still wouldn't have the vast resources to implement it. Rehabilitation requires a combination of measures, including academic education, vocational training, behavioral therapy, medication, and spiritual counseling. Keeping prisoners behind bars is expensive enough without adding a whole team of rehabilitation experts to the budget. The death penalty, when it is delivered swiftly, is far more cost effective.",[4],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

However, society needs to be able to send a message that certain behaviors are beyond redemption. There are some specific actsâ€”a category of crime, if you willâ€”that are so heinous, so reprehensible, and so outside the confines of any semblance of civilization, that the only response from a sane public is to eliminate the person(s) responsible. Situations like Sandy Hook, like Columbine, like 9/11 are operating on a level of criminality that is above and beyond any hope or possibility of forgiveness. There is no ""coming back"" from horrors such as these. There is no ""moving on"" after visiting such atrocities on the world. For that reason, death is the only viable solution.

However, compared with any other type of sentencing, the death penalty offers a permanent, long-term solution instead of a short-term fix or a gamble on rehabilitation. You can argue that the death penalty is cruel, that it is meted out unfairly, and any number of other arguments, but you can't claim that it doesn't solve the issue of repeat offenders with 100 percent effectiveness. When a death row prisoner is executed, there is no chance of recidivism.

However, sitting on death row actually provides a nearly perfect setting for reflecting on the actions that led the inmate to this fate. With lengthy appeals pretty much standard in death penalty cases, it isn't unusual for death row inmates to spend years awaiting their execution. During this time, they are separated from the general prison population. Thus, they have nothing to do but to think about what they've done and who they've wronged. They have time to come to terms with their offense, to make peace with their maker, even to finally express remorse for their crime and apologize to their victim. The death row inmate often has the opportunity to meet with clergy and confess, as well, another opportunity for self-reflection.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is â€œRehabilitationâ€. The second point is â€œWorldâ€™s trendâ€. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.","They said that death penalty should be abolished.

We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is â€œRehabilitationâ€. The second point is â€œWorldâ€™s trendâ€. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals.

However, we don't fully understand what causes criminal behavior, making this argument flawed and making rehabilitation a risky prospect. We know that two people with the same experiences and backgrounds may turn out to be quite different in many respects, including their propensity to commit crimes. So, we cannot blame society for making people into criminals, and we cannot expect the criminal justice system to magically transform a criminal into a law-abiding citizen. The roots of criminal behavior are quite complex, and probably include socio-economic circumstances as well as personality type, parenting style, trauma, and even brain chemistry. Without knowing what makes one person turn to a life of crime and another stick to the straight and narrow path, it's practically impossible to know how to change the former into the latter.","[3, 4]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
178,DP,5,116,"Todayâ€™s motion is â€œWe should abolish the death penalty.â€ We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define todayâ€™s motion. â€œTo abolishâ€ means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. â€œDeath penaltyâ€ refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ The second point is â€œRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.â€ Let me explain the first point, â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldnâ€™t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that restorative justice as an ideal form of justice; end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. However, one study says that, in Japan approximately 3 prisoners are hanged every year. That leads to reduction in crime rate in Japan. It is correct that, giving death penalty will create psychological fear to the persons those who are willing to commit such crimes in future. Such criminals are considered as predators in the society. There is no reason in arguing up-keeping such predators in the society. Try to understand the capital punishment is an act of justice and not an act of vengeance. It should be seemed as a consequence of disgraceful murderers. So I strongly support the death penalty.","[1, 2, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldnâ€™t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that restorative justice as an ideal form of justice; end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. However, one study says that, in Japan approximately 3 prisoners are hanged every year. That leads to reduction in crime rate in Japan. It is correct that, giving death penalty will create psychological fear to the persons those who are willing to commit such crimes in future. Such criminals are considered as predators in the society. There is no reason in arguing up-keeping such predators in the society.

A criminal might be way more dangerous and he might have put victims through very traumatic ordeal and causing them harm. If a state takes weak decisions, it might encourage the criminals that are willing to spend their lives in prison. This would be very bad for the society.

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define todayâ€™s motion. â€œTo abolishâ€ means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. â€œDeath penaltyâ€ refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ The second point is â€œRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.â€ Let me explain the first point, â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldnâ€™t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished.

Let me define todayâ€™s motion. â€œTo abolishâ€ means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. â€œDeath penaltyâ€ refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ The second point is â€œRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.â€ Let me explain the first point, â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldnâ€™t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished.

The first point is â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ The second point is â€œRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.â€ Let me explain the first point, â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldnâ€™t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that the brutality of the death penalty itself causes increasing brutality in modern society, such as the murder of children by their parents. However, the death penalty stands as a shield against barbaric crimes rather than a tool of barbarism. Imposition of the death penalty is handled in a civilized manner, and the prisoner is given every opportunity to prove his innocence, including the automatic right of appeal. Only a unanimous jury of peers can hand down such a sentence after weighing the strongest evidence, so the death penalty represents a just and sound act, not a barbaric or random one. Furthermore, whether by lethal injection or other method, the modern death penalty is imposed in a manner that is intended to be final but not painful. Instead of brutalizing society, this ultimate punishment serves as a strong message that our society does not permit brutality against innocents.",[2],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

However, there is little evidence to suggest that any truly innocent persons have been put to death in recent times -- at least since the beginning of the 20th century in the US. When capital punishment sentences are overturned on appeal, the typical result is conversion to a life sentence. Only in the rarest cases does an appeal result in a death penalty case being reversed, with the conviction tossed out. Furthermore, in such cases, the reason is typically a lack of overwhelming evidence or a legal technicality; for instance, juror or prosecutorial misconduct may be cited. In other words, winning an appeal doesn't mean the accused was actually innocent. In order to get a death sentence, a unanimous jury decision is needed, along with strong proof such as DNA evidence. Thus, wrongful convictions of the innocent are very rare in capital punishment cases in modern times.","[2, 3, 4]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The first point is â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ The second point is â€œRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.â€ Let me explain the first point, â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldnâ€™t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that the death penalty brutalizes society due to the chance of wrongful conviction of an innocent person. However, there is little evidence to suggest that any truly innocent persons have been put to death in recent times -- at least since the beginning of the 20th century in the US. When capital punishment sentences are overturned on appeal, the typical result is conversion to a life sentence. Only in the rarest cases does an appeal result in a death penalty case being reversed, with the conviction tossed out. Furthermore, in such cases, the reason is typically a lack of overwhelming evidence or a legal technicality; for instance, juror or prosecutorial misconduct may be cited. In other words, winning an appeal doesn't mean the accused was actually innocent. In order to get a death sentence, a unanimous jury decision is needed, along with strong proof such as DNA evidence.

However, the death penalty is imposed so rarely -- and so slowly -- that it hardly serves as an effective tool for the criminal bent on ""suicide by state"".  The sentence of death is handed down in a tiny fraction of court cases, requiring a unanimous jury verdict, an abundance of unquestionable evidence, and -- most significantly -- requiring the commission of the most heinous crime fitting the definition of a capital offense. After the verdict of death is rendered, a prisoner typically sits on death row for ten years or more. It isn't rare for a prisoner to await the death sentence for decades. Moreover, most cases involving a sentence of capital punishment result in conversion to a life sentence. Thus, unlike ""suicide by cop"" which does occur comparatively frequently and instantly, capital punishment isn't a practical way to achieve suicide by the state.","[2, 3, 4]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

Thank you.","They said that the death penalty should be abolished due to the chance that a criminal will kill in order to end his own life. However, the death penalty is imposed so rarely -- and so slowly -- that it hardly serves as an effective tool for the criminal bent on ""suicide by state"".  The sentence of death is handed down in a tiny fraction of court cases, requiring a unanimous jury verdict, an abundance of unquestionable evidence, and -- most significantly -- requiring the commission of the most heinous crime fitting the definition of a capital offense. After the verdict of death is rendered, a prisoner typically sits on death row for ten years or more. It isn't rare for a prisoner to await the death sentence for decades. Moreover, most cases involving a sentence of capital punishment result in conversion to a life sentence. Thus, unlike ""suicide by cop"" which does occur comparatively frequently and instantly, capital punishment isn't a practical way to achieve suicide by the state.",[1],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define todayâ€™s motion. â€œTo abolishâ€ means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. â€œDeath penaltyâ€ refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ The second point is â€œRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.â€ Let me explain the first point, â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment.

However, this argument does not demonstrate a cause and effect relationship whereby capital punishment causes brutality in society, including brutal crimes such as the killing of children by their parents and random murderous sprees. Instead, brutal crimes ""cause"" capital punishment. The death sentence is only handed down when a crime fitting the definition of capital offense occurs, including mass murder.

Let me define todayâ€™s motion. â€œTo abolishâ€ means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. â€œDeath penaltyâ€ refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ The second point is â€œRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.â€ Let me explain the first point, â€œBrutalization of the society.â€ Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someoneâ€™s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to â€œput an end to his own life,â€ according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldnâ€™t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished.

Therefore, there are no connection between taking this motion and students  independence. And there are no contradiction because first I said about serious students. And second, I said about most of students. Even if some students can think seriously, there are no relationship between homework.

In a real sense, homework straddles these two worlds by literally taking place after school, in preparation for what comes after graduation. Homework resembles and prepares students for the real world, where an authority figure like a teacher is typically not directly present -- in sight, and within easy reach. Nonetheless, that authority figure is still a force to be reckoned with for students, since failing to complete the assignment has repercussions like a failing grade. This is much like the real world, where the worker must have the initiative to do their work or suffer termination or demotion, even without a boss hovering over them.",[1],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

316,HW,2,cs4,"Hello everyone. Todayâ€™s topic is â€œHomework should be abolishedâ€. I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachersâ€ workloads.

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a â€œteacherâ€ who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do.

401,HW,3,cs50,"Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. Thatâ€™s how studying should be. Itâ€™s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished.

In the first place, students do not like studying. This is because it is difficult for some students to understand.

So if schools abolish homework, some students do not study at all. so many students do not study in the right way, moreover do not study at all.

However, you could apply this same logic to test taking: students who copy test answers from their neighbor can pass a test without understanding the material. But not many people would argue that this is a valid reason to do away with testing. In fact, you could argue that this is a good teaching opportunity for learning about ethics and the consequences of one's choices. Students who copy answers on tests and homework run the risk of copying bad work as well as the risk of getting caught and facing repercussions like failure or expulsion.

We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of â€œschoolsâ€ not â€œhomeâ€ to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the â€œresponsibility of schoolsâ€ and the second point is â€œincreasing creativityâ€. The first point â€œresponsibility of schoolsâ€ means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we donâ€™t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students canâ€™t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for childrenâ€™s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done â€œat schoolâ€ for fairness and effectiveness. Thatâ€™s why homework should be abolished.

The first point â€œresponsibility of schoolsâ€ means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we donâ€™t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students canâ€™t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for childrenâ€™s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful.

560,HW,5,cs37,"Hello everyone. Todayâ€™s motion is â€œHomework should be abolishedâ€. We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of â€œschoolsâ€ not â€œhomeâ€ to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the â€œresponsibility of schoolsâ€ and the second point is â€œincreasing creativityâ€. The first point â€œresponsibility of schoolsâ€ means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we donâ€™t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students canâ€™t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for childrenâ€™s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done â€œat schoolâ€ for fairness and effectiveness. Thatâ€™s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that elementary school students should learn all they need to know to function in society at school and that homework should not be mandatory because some children do not have two parents or parents who are willing or able to help them with it. However, in order for students to really grasp what is being taught to them in schools, homework is a necessity. People of all ages tend to forget things they learn right after they learn them. If children aren't made to go home and use what they learned to complete the homework, they won't be able to remember as much, which would make the work at school useless.
