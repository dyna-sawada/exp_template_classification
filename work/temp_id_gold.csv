0,DP,2,11,"Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Death penalty should be abolished”. I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that because mistakes are human nature, the risk of misjudgment in death sentence cases is too great. However, this argument makes quite a leap in logic. We are exposed to risks due to human error in nearly every aspect of life, yet we accept those risks for the most part. The cost of human error is, admittedly, greater in some instances than others. But death penalty cases aren't alone in carrying a life-or-death risk. When we decide to travel by plane, for instance, we accept the potentially fatal risk of human error on the part of the pilot and air traffic controller. Likewise, a heart surgeon's built-in human error puts all of his patients' lives at risk. The best we can due is to minimize the risk of human error wherever we encounter it. In capital punishment cases, this means demanding effective legal counsel and unbiased juries, as an example.","[2, 3, 5]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

However, reducing the chances of mistakes of judgment in capital punishment should then be the goal. Instead of abandoning the death penalty, which is an effective tool of the criminal justice system, we should work to lower the incidence of mistaken judgment in such cases. One way to do this is to raise the bar for cases deemed suitable to warrant the death penalty. Another way is to increase the burden of proof needed for a conviction in a capital punishment case. Expanding the number of jurors and insisting on a unanimous juror verdict in death penalty case would also lower the odds of misjudgment. Likewise, juries should be better educated about applying the death penalty, and they should be protected from retribution and prohibited from profiting from their participation -- ensuring that jurors vote based on evidence only.","[3, 4]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

However, it is a myth that death row is filled with truly innocent individuals. The majority of death sentences end up being reduced on appeal. However, that certainly doesn't mean that the majority of those sentenced to death were innocent. Typically, sentences are reduced due to legal technicalities and due to issues unrelated to innocence such as jury tampering and prosecutorial misconduct. While death row cases do in fact account for a preponderance of exonerations, this doesn't mean each exonerated party was actually innocent. An exoneration might indicate a lack of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, for instance.

Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that the death sentence doesn't allow a chance to reverse a legal mistake, so it should be abolished. However, actually, the ability to reverse a legal mistake is part of every death row sentence in the form of an automatic appeal. As part of the appeals process, the convicted criminal isn't limited to having his original trial record reviewed. There are a variety of legal issues that the convicted party can exploit in hopes of winning a lesser sentence or gaining release from prison. For instance, he can complain about misconduct by a jury member or lack of effective counsel. He can introduce new evidence into the case, or he can claim that evidence was withheld by the state. Because the appeals process is a right of the death row inmate, there is ample chance for him to prove his true innocence or to gain freedom due to a legal loophole.","[2, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that the death penalty is a cruel penalty. However, the death penalty is a cruel penalty is a fact. But it is not a know fact to criminals. No criminal will apologize to the law saying that he don't know the punishment he is going to get if he do a crime. If a criminal uses such excuse then he must be a mental disability person or he must be under age group of 18 or may be an immatured person. In such case the punishment must be decided after thinking more .",[4],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands.

Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that the death penalty should be abolished due to causing stress to the suffering the executioner faces and the cruelty of the death penalty. However, I do not think that abolishing the death penalty would be effective. The reason for this is that life imprisonment poses a huge financial burden on the local community. You have to house the inmate, provide food for the inmate, and also healthcare. You could be looking at millions of dollars over the life of the inmate that the local community has to pay for. That is not fair to the community that the prison or jail is located in. The inmate does not deserve ""humanity"", or ""sympathy"". The crimes that they committed are severe enough for the death penalty. The second point of executioners suffering, is flawed because the executioner is performing this role voluntarily.

However, this issue isn't with the death penalty as a form of punishment, but with the effect on the executioner. So, that is what we should focus on solving.

The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that executioners feel a sense of responsibility or blame, so the death penalty should be abolished to spare them. However, while it is understandable that participating in an execution could lead to feelings of guilt, the executioner actually holds no blame. The solution is to educate would-be executioners so they understand their small but vital role in the criminal justice system. Executioners should be educated on all the steps in the legal process, understanding the weight of evidence against the accused, and the roles played by the judge and jury in the case -- who bear much more responsibility for the judgment of death. By letting would-be executioners see that the justice system is fair and that only those with undeniable evidence against them receive this sentence, they will understand who bears the real guilt in death penalty cases.",[3],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The executioner is powerless to choose life or death for the prisoner, so he bears no blame. We can't abolish a legal and effective form of punishment simply because prison officials who participate in executions have a conscience. In fact, this just shows that people in the criminal justice system aren't evil, and that they do empathize with even the worst members of society. This is in contrast to the criminal who shows no empathy for his victims. So, an executioner who feels responsible should be educated to understand that the decision of life or death rests with the court system, and that the choice to do wrong is solely the fault of the criminal.",[6],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is “Executioner's suffering”. The second point is “Cruelty of death penalty”. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands.

136,DP,4,10,"Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.","They said that rehabilitation of criminals, not capital punishment, is what we should strive for. However, the idea of being able to transform a criminal into a contributing member of society is a lofty ideal. If it worked, and if we had evidence of its success, rehabilitation might be the ultimate goal of prison. However, we don't have a formula for how to rehabilitate prisoners whose criminal behavior has multiple and often unknown causes. And, even if we had such a formula, we still wouldn't have the vast resources to implement it.

However, sitting on death row actually provides a nearly perfect setting for reflecting on the actions that led the inmate to this fate.

During this time, they are separated from the general prison population. Thus, they have nothing to do but to think about what they've done and who they've wronged. They have time to come to terms with their offense, to make peace with their maker, even to finally express remorse for their crime and apologize to their victim.

149,DP,4,20,"Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps.

We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals.

First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.","They said that rehabilitation, not execution, is the responsible option for those who commit the most serious crimes. However, like it or not, prisons have to operate within a budget. Taxpayers already complain about the high cost of keeping criminals behind bars. Thus, we need to prioritize where to invest taxpayer dollars in the criminal justice system to get the best return on our investment. Investing in costly rehab programs for the worst violent offenders who are supposed to be serving life terms seems foolhardy. Wouldn't it make more sense to spend that money on trying to rehabilitate first offenders and non-violent criminals, so they can succeed outside prison and have no desire or need to ever return to a life of crime? After all, these more minor offenders actually do have a chance of becoming contributing members of society and even taxpayers themselves.",[6],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.","They said that we should try to rehabilitate even those who randomly kill many people. However, unfortunately, some people are probably beyond rehabilitation. Logically, the people most resistant to genuine rehabilitation are also probably the same people who commit heinous capital crimes, such as mass murderers and terrorists. Some of these people are true psychopaths or sociopaths who may be able to mimic ""normal"" behavior, and pretend that they are rehabilitated, just long enough to get released back into society. However, once they no longer have a motive to feign remorse and repentance, there is a real risk they will return to criminal behavior and perhaps even escalate their crimes, since they escaped the death penalty once. This is the type of scenario that capital punishment avoids. So, if keeping society safe from the most dangerous criminals is your goal, rehabilitation doesn't really fit as the strategy.",[3],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
210,DP,4,99,"Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is “Rehabilitation”. The second point is “World’s trend”. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment.

Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.","They said that society creates criminals, so society has a burden to rehabilitate them. However, we don't fully understand what causes criminal behavior, making this argument flawed and making rehabilitation a risky prospect. We know that two people with the same experiences and backgrounds may turn out to be quite different in many respects, including their propensity to commit crimes. So, we cannot blame society for making people into criminals, and we cannot expect the criminal justice system to magically transform a criminal into a law-abiding citizen. The roots of criminal behavior are quite complex, and probably include socio-economic circumstances as well as personality type, parenting style, trauma, and even brain chemistry. Without knowing what makes one person turn to a life of crime and another stick to the straight and narrow path, it's practically impossible to know how to change the former into the latter.","[3, 4]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
211,DP,5,116,"Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that restorative justice as an ideal form of justice; end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. However, one study says that, in Japan approximately 3 prisoners are hanged every year. That leads to reduction in crime rate in Japan. It is correct that, giving death penalty will create psychological fear to the persons those who are willing to commit such crimes in future. Such criminals are considered as predators in the society. There is no reason in arguing up-keeping such predators in the society. Try to understand the capital punishment is an act of justice and not an act of vengeance. It should be seemed as a consequence of disgraceful murderers. So I strongly support the death penalty.","[1, 2, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that restorative justice as an ideal form of justice; end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. However, one study says that, in Japan approximately 3 prisoners are hanged every year. That leads to reduction in crime rate in Japan. It is correct that, giving death penalty will create psychological fear to the persons those who are willing to commit such crimes in future. Such criminals are considered as predators in the society. There is no reason in arguing up-keeping such predators in the society. Try to understand the capital punishment is an act of justice and not an act of vengeance. It should be seemed as a consequence of disgraceful murderers. So I strongly support the death penalty.",[5],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

If one or both of the kidneys are damaged peoples are required to operate and cut off and replace the kidneys. Some times any human body part becomes infected by 'Cancer' and to save human life it is necessary to cut off that very part. These is very incidents known to all in our society and these can not be called as 'Brutalization'. When some people acts like 'Cancer' or the society considers one as a 'Cancer' to society it is necessary to cut off the part. So Death Penalty should not be abolished.","[3, 4]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified.

Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society. However, there is no evidence or statistical data to suggest that modern society is any more brutal today than in the past, and that the cause of this brutality is the death penalty.  It is true that there are instances where brutality occurs.  Such instances may involve cases of domestic violence or mass shootings in public places.  These cases are less common than the media portrays.  Furthermore, there has been no evidence put forth that the occurrence of such incidents are the direct result of the death penalty.

248,DP,5,149,"Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street.

We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. However, there has always been crime even before governments implemented any kind of justice. Justice was established in order to enforce the laws that were enacted in order for society to function. The people who do not abide by these laws need to have repercussions for not following these laws. In the case of crimes against someone where their life is taken or where someone is harmed for life there needs to be a type of justice that not only punishes the criminal but deters those who would commit those crimes in the future. When we take away harsh punishment people are not as deterred.

267,DP,5,37,"Today’s motion is “We should abolish the death penalty.” We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that there may be an intentional abuse of the system. However, given the example about the man in Hokkaido in 2016, this argument doesn't hold up. It's wrong to say that we know for certain that if the worst punishment was life in prison, the man wouldn't have killed. This is leaving things to theory or relying on a hypothetical scenario.

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street.

In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake.

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today’s motion. “To abolish” means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. “Death penalty” refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is “Brutalization of the society.” The second point is “Restorative justice as an ideal form of justice.” Let me explain the first point, “Brutalization of the society.” Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone’s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone’s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to “put an end to his own life,” according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn’t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that people can be incentivized to commit crimes because they want to end their life, so the death punishment is a reward. However, the small number of cases where a crime was committed with hopes of achieving the death penalty are statistically irrelevant in comparison to the overwhelming amount of crimes that are prevented because criminals fear the death penalty.

In fact, if a student has a legitimate reason for needing extra time for homework, most teachers will be reasonable enough to grant it. This argument also assumes that homework assignments are given on such short notice that it's impossible to get the work done while balancing other activities. In fact, most teachers recognize that kids participate in extra-curricular activities and encourage that participation. Consequently, it is rare for teachers to assign so much homework that it can't possibly be done while also having time for clubs and sports.

Thank you.","They said that a school is not a place where students only learn to study. However, it is not true. We strongly believe that school should prioritize the quality of study rather than making student passive because academic background is more important than passive character. Currently, many business corporations often evaluate obedient people because corporations consisted by many stuffs and require spirit of cooperation. So, even if student are passive they can join such companies, if they have enough level of education. So we are concern that academic skills are much important than passive character.","[3, 4, 5]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers’ workloads.

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do.

That is to say if abolishing homework, students become passive in character. This is because students are instructed by teachers in club activity or cram school in many situation. For example if you go to the cram school, the teachers give you a lot of homework. Moreover parents instructed their children to study in their house.

Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

In order to judge students’ ability, teachers put on homework. Thus, students have to plan their schedule. For example, they have to calculate the time for homework. Furthermore, given homework, they can automatically notice their study ability. By those tendency, they improve their study plan. In those processes, teacher donot intervene each student. Therefore, even in current situation, students always manage what they need to do, and teachers are testing the management ability through homework.","[1, 7]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

However, this argument assumes that homework is always forced on students and that students have no say in whether to do the work. In fact, students always have the choice to do the homework or face the consequences of failing to do their work. This teaches students an important lesson that applies to the real world: that choices have consequences. Homework is actually an ideal tool to teach this lesson, since students make the choice without the domineering presence of their teacher. Furthermore, homework assignments are not necessarily ""forced"" on students. Wise teachers know that homework is more appealing when it includes freedom and options, such as a choice between writing a book report or designing a book cover. In this way, homework is not passive work forced on the student, but work that requires the student to take charge and make choices.","[1, 7]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

However, this argument assumes that homework is always forced on students and that students have no say in whether to do the work. In fact, students always have the choice to do the homework or face the consequences of failing to do their work. This teaches students an important lesson that applies to the real world: that choices have consequences. Homework is actually an ideal tool to teach this lesson, since students make the choice without the domineering presence of their teacher. Furthermore, homework assignments are not necessarily ""forced"" on students. Wise teachers know that homework is more appealing when it includes freedom and options, such as a choice between writing a book report or designing a book cover. In this way, homework is not passive work forced on the student, but work that requires the student to take charge and make choices.","[3, 7]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That’s how studying should be. It’s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That’s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that some students tend to dislike studying and forcing homework to children is one of the reasons of it, thus homework should be abolished. However, even if it is true, then why should we prior “some” children who dislike studying to other children who like or can do studying well in the first place. For the latter children, abolishing homework is robbing what they want to do or what they can do well. Therefore, government should explain it, and if they can’t, what Prime Minister said is not the effective reason to abolish homework.",[1],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.","They said that homework should be abolished. However, abolishing homework might seem like a great thing from the outset. Who is this going to be more beneficial to? That’s something that is hard for me to pinpoint. I’m leaning that it’s better for the lazy and unmotivated student. They did not want to do homework anyways. Their main reason was not being pressed for time either. It was all about not wanting to put forth the effort. The students that are pressed for time with extracurricular activities will not benefit as much as you think. They will find other things to take up their time. Perhaps it will be some other club. So I’m the end, you’re not rewarding students with more time to concentrate or better studying behavior. It’s going to give bad students a break and not really change much with the good students.","[4, 6, 7]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

But not many people would argue that this is a valid reason to do away with testing. In fact, you could argue that this is a good teaching opportunity for learning about ethics and the consequences of one's choices. Students who copy answers on tests and homework run the risk of copying bad work as well as the risk of getting caught and facing repercussions like failure or expulsion. Students also learn, over time, that copying work is counter to actually studying and learning the material. Abolishing testing or homework deprives students of the chance to learn this.",[5],"[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is “harmful efforts” and the second point is “decreasing teacher’s burden”. Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing.

Repetition is usually a good learning technique.

That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful.

It's unfair. 
. However, it's not true. This unfairness doesn't matter. Because even if some parents are busy and can't help their children, but still children can ask their teachers some questions. Also, this opportunity is equally accessible for every students. They can ask teachers after the homeroom or classes. Also, teachers will answer the questions kindly because they have incentive to do so.  So, there is no unfairness during the process of doing homework.

However, it's not true. Rather, in terms of efficiency, our side is better. Because without the proper guidelines, students can't know what they should do at home. They are not educational professionals so they can't know what problems are good to practice to solve. Even if they can think about what they do, still they don't know whether they can study comprehensively. So, homework is necessary to know what they should do to review something efficiently because it can be guidelines of studying.

630,HW,5,7,"Hello everyone. Today’s motion is “Homework should be abolished”. We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.","They said that we cannot ensure fairness among children with homework. However, it's not true.
This is because their analysis here is so doubtful. They tried to say that ""when children face some difficulty on their homework, they have to rely on their parents."" However, that assumption is not correct. If they hope, they can access to free education systems. For example, there are many NPOs which provide the free education. Even if their countries don't have it, they can ask teachers the questions.

Even though one student might have an easier time if he can get his brother or mother to help him complete an assignment, he won't learn how to do the assignment himself the way another student who can't ask his family for help will, which balances out the disadvantages in the long term.","[1, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
644,HW,5,cs20,"Hello everyone. Today’s motion is “Homework should be abolished”. We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students.

The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful.

658,HW,5,cs49,"Hello everyone. Today’s motion is “Homework should be abolished”. We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of “schools” not “home” to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the “responsibility of schools” and the second point is “increasing creativity”. The first point “responsibility of schools” means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don’t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can’t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children’s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done “at school” for fairness and effectiveness. That’s why homework should be abolished.
