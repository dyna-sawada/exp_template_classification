    "lo_speech": "They said that because mistakes are human nature, the risk of misjudgment in death sentence cases is too great. However, this argument makes quite a leap in logic. We are exposed to risks due to human error in nearly every aspect of life, yet we accept those risks for the most part. The cost of human error is, admittedly, greater in some instances than others. But death penalty cases aren't alone in carrying a life-or-death risk. When we decide to travel by plane, for instance, we accept the potentially fatal risk of human error on the part of the pilot and air traffic controller. Likewise, a heart surgeon's built-in human error puts all of his patients' lives at risk. The best we can due is to minimize the risk of human error wherever we encounter it. In capital punishment cases, this means demanding effective legal counsel and unbiased juries, as an example.",

There must be irrefutable evidence against them to make sure an innocent person is not sentenced.  People make mistakes but the death penalty is given to people who knowingly commit the crime.",

However, reducing the chances of mistakes of judgment in capital punishment should then be the goal. Instead of abandoning the death penalty, which is an effective tool of the criminal justice system, we should work to lower the incidence of mistaken judgment in such cases. One way to do this is to raise the bar for cases deemed suitable to warrant the death penalty. Another way is to increase the burden of proof needed for a conviction in a capital punishment case. Expanding the number of jurors and insisting on a unanimous juror verdict in death penalty case would also lower the odds of misjudgment. Likewise, juries should be better educated about applying the death penalty, and they should be protected from retribution and prohibited from profiting from their participation -- ensuring that jurors vote based on evidence only.",

However, it is a myth that death row is filled with truly innocent individuals. The majority of death sentences end up being reduced on appeal. However, that certainly doesn't mean that the majority of those sentenced to death were innocent. Typically, sentences are reduced due to legal technicalities and due to issues unrelated to innocence such as jury tampering and prosecutorial misconduct. While death row cases do in fact account for a preponderance of exonerations, this doesn't mean each exonerated party was actually innocent. An exoneration might indicate a lack of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, for instance.

However, this argument assumes that the death sentence is carried out before a mistake can be found. In fact, inmates typically spend years and often decades on death row. This allows time to catch mistakes made in the original trial and rectify them. A great many death row sentences are reduced to life sentences on appeal, which demonstrates that a death sentence isn't absolute. Moreover, death penalty cases represent a much larger percentage of total exonerations, where the original charges are dismissed altogether. This further suggests that death sentences can be changed and that death row inmates actually have a greater chance of obtaining justice, due to the extraordinary amount of focus on their cases.",

Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It\u2019s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty doesn't make society safer because innocent people can be killed. However, this argument ignores the many ways that the death penalty protects society from harm. By permanently removing the most dangerous criminals from society, the death penalty serves as a safeguard against the loss of future lives. Furthermore, by serving to deter others from committing crimes that carry a death sentence, including mass murder and terrorism, the death penalty prevents additional casualties. Executions also protect fellow inmates and prison workers from the threat of death or injury at the hands of a violent criminal given a sentence other than capital punishment. So, when you balance the tiny number of truly innocent people who are executed against the many future lives that can be spared by retaining the death penalty, it's clear that this sentence keeps society safer.",

Some criminal offenses and corresponding criminals are identified as clear as day light. Some of these criminals regrets for their doings and they feel sorrow for what happened. But some criminals make happen the incident with long plans and cold head. They also have no regret for their doing. They do not feel sorry or even they do not accept that what they made happen were wrong. Actually they are not the part of humanity and society. A longer life of their is the threat to other human and society. It increase the doubts and distrust between people. So it is safe for society to eliminate these creature without spending time and money for them. To ensure safety and belief it is necessary that Death penalty should not be abolished.",

However, actually, the ability to reverse a legal mistake is part of every death row sentence in the form of an automatic appeal. As part of the appeals process, the convicted criminal isn't limited to having his original trial record reviewed. There are a variety of legal issues that the convicted party can exploit in hopes of winning a lesser sentence or gaining release from prison. For instance, he can complain about misconduct by a jury member or lack of effective counsel. He can introduce new evidence into the case, or he can claim that evidence was withheld by the state. Because the appeals process is a right of the death row inmate, there is ample chance for him to prove his true innocence or to gain freedom due to a legal loophole.",

However, in general misjudgements in the legal system are fairly rare and most judgements are found to be appropriate upon review. Particularly in the situation when a death penalty is sought the standard for determining the guilt of the accused is raised considerably higher than the standard used in most other cases. So the judge and jury already realize that they really have to look in depth at the situation. Additionally the person found guilty is required to appeal the decision because of exactly this sort of possibility. During the appeals process different evidence can be produced based on the particular reason that guilt was determined. The defendant can also change their legal team if they believe that they are being represented poorly.",

Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It\u2019s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \u201cNo\u201d. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It\u2019s much safer society.

    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished because it is terrible. However, the death penalty can bring closure to families in ways that having someone in prison for life does not bring. Taking away the death penalty takes away closure from grieving families. The act that someone carried out on this family's loved one is terrible and the chance that it happened is much higher than the chance that a mistake was made. With the technology that exists the chance that there was a mistake is very low.",

However, this argument is a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Just because a tiny fraction of those executed may have been innocent doesn't mean the death penalty doesn't have more benefits than disadvantages. Instead of getting rid of the death penalty, we should be focused on eliminating the chance of error resulting in the execution of the truly innocent. One way this is already occurring is by increasingly relying on the strongest, most foolproof evidence: DNA left at the scene. Furthermore, video captured by security cameras is replacing eyewitness testimony, which has a greater chance of inaccuracy due to imperfect human memory. Another way mistakes can be reduced is by increasing use of all the legal avenues of redress, including the appeals process. Error reduction should be the focus rather than elimination of a penalty that protects society.",

A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher\u2019s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don\u2019t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers\u2019 stress is extremely overwhelming. That\u2019s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that death penalty should be abolished. However, we cannot abolish the death penalty. Too many victims have lost their lives to evil people. These evil people need to suffer that same fate. The families of the victims need justice. Life is prison is not justice. It\u2019s a slap in the face to the victims abs their families. Anyone who mentions the cruelty of the death penalty must have forgotten some of the acts these inmates committed. Where is the passion and sympathy for the victims? Let\u2019s honor them and their loved ones and stop advocating for the rights of their murderers.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished due to causing stress to the suffering the executioner faces and the cruelty of the death penalty. However, I do not think that abolishing the death penalty would be effective. The reason for this is that life imprisonment poses a huge financial burden on the local community. You have to house the inmate, provide food for the inmate, and also healthcare. You could be looking at millions of dollars over the life of the inmate that the local community has to pay for. That is not fair to the community that the prison or jail is located in. The inmate does not deserve \"humanity\", or \"sympathy\". The crimes that they committed are severe enough for the death penalty. The second point of executioners suffering, is flawed because the executioner is performing this role voluntarily. If they are traumatized by it, then they should select a different career path.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that prison workers who take part in executions suffer stress, so the death penalty should be eliminated. However, instead of abolishing a punishment that the Constitution endorses, we should find ways to effectively deal with executioner stress. Obviously, if the job involves carrying out executions on a daily basis, without relief or counseling, the executioner is going to feel bad and probably exhibit PTSD. We can combat that by making sure would-be executioners are fully prepared for the job, that they are mentally sound and have a good support system. In addition, we can relieve the stress of dealing with executions day in and day out by rotating the task so the number of executions carried out by a single guard is limited. In this way, executioner stress is reduced and the ultimate penalty can remain a legal option for the worst crimes.",

Instead of hanging the criminal by the executers , make the criminals attempt to suicide by them self in front of the executers by giving them some poison which must be taken by themselves. in such cases there is no need of a person to execute such death penalty and he wont feel guilty or sorry for the death of that crime.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that executioners feel responsible for killing, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, this issue isn't with the death penalty as a form of punishment, but with the effect on the executioner. So, that is what we should focus on solving. In some ways, it's hard to understand why an executioner should feel responsible, when they are merely carrying out orders. However, we can take steps to help remove the burden of guilt and responsibility nonetheless. For instance, like the example cited above where multiple prison officers push a button, we could have every person on duty line up to press a button -- from the prison warden down to the cafeteria workers. By increasing the pool of participants, no one would think they were the one that dealt the fatal punishment, and we could keep the death penalty on the books for the worst offenses.",

In addition to crime victims and their loved ones, there are probably a lot of people who would feel no guilt about serving as executioner in a case where the accused committed a horrific crime and was found guilty by his peers. In fact, a lottery might have to be held to award the executioner role, due to the vast number of applicants for the task. Maybe it would be better to let ordinary citizens instead of prison workers do this job anyway, in the same way we let ordinary citizens sit on the juries that decide the fate of prisoners, including life or death sentences.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that we should abolish the death penalty because it's a burden on the executioner. However, most jobs come with burdens, some heavier than others. However, jobs with the heaviest burdens are also often the most important. For instance, throughout our history we have used soldiers to fight for our country, and some of those soldiers had to kill as part of their job. Yet, we venerate soldiers and their sacrifice. Instead of deciding that fighting for our country isn't a valid cause, we celebrate our soldiers and try to prepare them for war, and take care of them if they return from war with trauma. We should do the same for those who take part in carrying out the ultimate sentence in our justice system, instead of deciding that the punishment is the problem.",

In fact, the given argument argues against this, by pointing out that with some executions there is more than one executioner, so the guilt can not be linked to one individual. It only takes 1 person to volunteer to do the job, and I am sure that if you survey society you will find a por-death penalty person willing to do it and not feel stressed about it.",

However, if executioner stress is the issue, then the most direct answer is to find a way to lower that stress, rather than to get rid of a legal option for punishing criminals. There are actually a number of ways to minimize the stress of executions for those who take part in them. In addition to the example given, where none of the guards knows who pushes the 'kill' switch, executioners can rotate jobs, get extra counseling and days off, and get assurance that the death-row inmate has been made comfortable and will fill no pain. Moreover, if the executioner knows that the inmate himself is prepared to accept his death, then feelings of guilt can be reduced. These are better solutions than abolishing an effective deterrent.",

However, in death penalty cases, there is always going to be suffering, but the executioner's pain is nothing compared to the victim's. In addition, the executioner's suffering can be minimized, but the victim's often cannot. One way to help executioner's reduce their sense of stress and pain over partaking in this punishment is to understand the power of delivering justice and closure to the victim and their loved ones. Before the execution date, the would-be executioner should meet with the survivors of the crime, to understand their pain and what relief they will achieve from the execution. By sharing and empathizing with the victims, the executioner's own suffering will be lessened and a sense of peach can be achieved by all.",

Executioners should be educated on all the steps in the legal process, understanding the weight of evidence against the accused, and the roles played by the judge and jury in the case -- who bear much more responsibility for the judgment of death. By letting would-be executioners see that the justice system is fair and that only those with undeniable evidence against them receive this sentence, they will understand who bears the real guilt in death penalty cases.",

There is no such thing as executioner stress. The argument against the death penalty also lacks context.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \u201cExecutioner's suffering\u201d. The second point is \u201cCruelty of death penalty\u201d. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher\u2019s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don\u2019t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers\u2019 stress is extremely overwhelming. That\u2019s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished. However, the death penalty should not be abolished. It serves an important purpose in society. There are certain crimes that are so serious that the offender should forfeit their right to live. In the case of an execution, it could be automated, or carried out by multiple people pressing a button, such that no individual person is ever fully responsible for the death of another person. No single person would ever have to feel like they were the one who made the decision to end another's life. The death penalty can be an important deterrent to those who might consider committing serious crimes. It is the only proper and sufficient form of punishment for the most heinous of crimes.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that we should abolish the death penalty because executioners feel responsible for killing. However, it is not the executioner who is responsible when a death row inmate dies. The executioner is powerless to choose life or death for the prisoner, so he bears no blame. We can't abolish a legal and effective form of punishment simply because prison officials who participate in executions have a conscience. In fact, this just shows that people in the criminal justice system aren't evil, and that they do empathize with even the worst members of society. This is in contrast to the criminal who shows no empathy for his victims. So, an executioner who feels responsible should be educated to understand that the decision of life or death rests with the court system, and that the choice to do wrong is solely the fault of the criminal.",

However, I feel that it is the crime itself that was cruel, and that it would be cruel to leave society at large at risk of being re-victimized.

This is something that crime victims do not get the curtesy of. The death penalty is also carried out in a swift manner to be as painless as possible.",

If an Executioner suffers from mental stress like anxiety or depression he can always seek medical care. There are specialized Psychiatrists to help them. The Executioners are well trained and they are aware of the risks involved in execution of the convict on death row. Not everyone can become an Executioner. It takes experience and they are careful chosen after evaluating their track record at work. The Executioner is also not forced to do his job. He can always quit his job and pursue an alternate career. Death penalty is no longer cruel. Most countries have abolished hanging and they use only injections to kill the suspect. Injections also ensure that the suspect dies peacefully. The Executioner may be killing the suspect but he is actually doing his duty to protect the society.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \u201cExecutioner's suffering\u201d. The second point is \u201cCruelty of death penalty\u201d. I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher\u2019s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don\u2019t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers\u2019 stress is extremely overwhelming. That\u2019s why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that carrying out the death penalty causes the executioner to suffer, so it should be abolished. However, if it were true that executioners suffer terribly because of their part in capital punishment, wouldn't we hear about a dire shortage of these workers? Being an executioner is part of a prison job, which is a voluntary position, meaning the person had to seek out the job. No one is being forced against their will to carry out a legal execution. So, the assumption of suffering and stress on the part of the executioner is unproven and probably exaggerated. For all we know, executioners feel relief and pride instead of stress when they perform a job intended to keep society safe and bring justice to victims. Thus, this argument is too weak to stand.",

However, there are now sophisticated computers that can take the place of the executioner therefore relieving the stress of being the person that actually pushes the button or pulls the lever. The computer can be programed from a different location for the time the execution is taking place. The person who programs the computer need not know the reason for the program and never feels the stress of killing another human being. The disassociation to the deed will then not cause the executioner any stress or guilt feelings. Computers have no feelings and only do what they are programmed to do. No human ever need to feel the stress of killing another human.",

Rather than toss out a form of punishment that may serve as an effective deterrent, the better solution is to address what is causing executioner stress. Perhaps executioners are stressed because they don't want to hurt a prisoner they work closely with on a daily basis. One way to address this is to choose for the role of executioner prison workers who don't otherwise have contact with death row inmates. Another way is to ensure that executions themselves are as painless as possible, and make sure that executioners understand that the penalty is carried out in the most humane manner available.",

However, executioners are not actually responsible for the life or death of an inmate.

Thus, the executioner only acts as a small cog in the big machine that is the criminal justice system. Consequently, those who take part in the execution don't bear the burden of guilt: if anything, they can blame the criminal himself for choosing to disobey the law, or blame the lawyer for failing to present a strong enough case, or blame the jury for their decision. The executioner is the least responsible and the most blameless, in reality.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is \u201cRehabilitation\u201d. The second point is \u201cWorld\u2019s trend\u201d. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that rehabilitation of criminals, not capital punishment, is what we should strive for. However, the idea of being able to transform a criminal into a contributing member of society is a lofty ideal. If it worked, and if we had evidence of its success, rehabilitation might be the ultimate goal of prison. However, we don't have a formula for how to rehabilitate prisoners whose criminal behavior has multiple and often unknown causes. And, even if we had such a formula, we still wouldn't have the vast resources to implement it. Rehabilitation requires a combination of measures, including academic education, vocational training, behavioral therapy, medication, and spiritual counseling. Keeping prisoners behind bars is expensive enough without adding a whole team of rehabilitation experts to the budget. The death penalty, when it is delivered swiftly, is far more cost effective.",

Situations like Sandy Hook, like Columbine, like 9/11 are operating on a level of criminality that is above and beyond any hope or possibility of forgiveness. There is no \"coming back\" from horrors such as these. There is no \"moving on\" after visiting such atrocities on the world. For that reason, death is the only viable solution.

    "pm_speech": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is \u201cRehabilitation\u201d. The second point is \u201cWorld\u2019s trend\u201d. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that unlike rehabilitation, the death penalty solves nothing, so it should be abolished. However, compared with any other type of sentencing, the death penalty offers a permanent, long-term solution instead of a short-term fix or a gamble on rehabilitation. You can argue that the death penalty is cruel, that it is meted out unfairly, and any number of other arguments, but you can't claim that it doesn't solve the issue of repeat offenders with 100 percent effectiveness. When a death row prisoner is executed, there is no chance of recidivism. Perhaps even more importantly, there is absolute closure -- or as close to absolute closure as we can get -- for the crime victim and their loved ones. Thus, it is completely untrue that the death penalty isn't an effective and practically foolproof solution to a real problem.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished because it denies criminals the chance to reflect on what they've done. However, sitting on death row actually provides a nearly perfect setting for reflecting on the actions that led the inmate to this fate. With lengthy appeals pretty much standard in death penalty cases, it isn't unusual for death row inmates to spend years awaiting their execution. During this time, they are separated from the general prison population. Thus, they have nothing to do but to think about what they've done and who they've wronged. They have time to come to terms with their offense, to make peace with their maker, even to finally express remorse for their crime and apologize to their victim. The death row inmate often has the opportunity to meet with clergy and confess, as well, another opportunity for self-reflection.",

However, i respectfully argue that there are many flaws in your argument.  first of all, i don't believe there is any thing that guarantees a person who receives a life sentence will actually spend the rest of their life in jail.  factors such as good behavior, pleas to parole boards and other factors sometimes make the term \"life sentence\" meaningless.   just as important is your argument that the person serving a life sentence will continue to spend their life reflecting on what they did.    how can we assume that is the case? we don't know what percentage of the time he is doing any reflecting at all.  there is just as much of a chance that he is reflecting on whether to use the prison library or watch the prison television.  the problem with your argument is you are thinking about the murderer and not the victim.  thank you.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that prisoners deserve to be rehabilitated, so the death penalty is wrong. However, rehabilitation, like criminal behavior, is largely a matter of choice. Unless someone wants to be rehabilitated, no amount of spiritual counseling, vocational training and therapy is going to change that person. In the case of criminals found guilty of capital crimes that carry the death penalty -- including mass murder and terrorism -- the possibility of real rehabilitation is even more remote. Yes, we can increase participation in rehabilitation programs by offering enticements such as extra TV time or family visits, but this strategy is a bit like bribing a toddler with a treat: the results are likely to be short-term at best, and the effect tends to disappear when the incentive is removed. Moreover, we need to recognize that criminals learn to manipulate the system, so can we really trust a mass murderer who claims to have repented and seen the light?",

    "lo_speech": "They said that we should abolish the death penalty in favor of rehabilitation. However, this argument does not cite any evidence that rehabilitation of death row inmates works or that it is effective by any measure of success. We know that many ex-cons return to a life of crime after their release, based on recidivism rates. It is also true that violent criminals tend to be more likely to repeat their crimes, and violence is surely a characteristic of most crimes deemed worthy of capital punishment. It is too dangerous to put the safety of society at risk on the chance that death row criminals can be truly rehabilitated. As with all investments, we have to consider the risk-return ratio of any type of punishment. An execution provides a sure result, while rehabilitation is a risky gamble.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is \u201cRehabilitation\u201d. The second point is \u201cWorld\u2019s trend\u201d. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that prisoner rehabilitation is the responsibility of the nation. However, if we are going to be serious about rehabilitation, we have to be willing to invest significant resources into these programs. And, if the goal of rehabilitation is reintegration of the prisoner into society, we have to continue to invest once the convict is released. In order to fund these expensive programs, we have to convince taxpayers that spending even more of their tax dollars on criminals is worthwhile and that it is actually their responsibility. Then, we have to change society's attitude about criminals so that communities embrace ex-convicts rather than ostracizing them. And we can't neglect the job of fixing societal problems that contribute to the risk of criminal behavior. These are all lofty goals, but there is no explanation of how any of this can be accomplished.",

However, rehabilitation is just one of the goals of the criminal justice system. It is a mistake to put all the focus on this one goal, while ignoring the others. A prison sentence is also supposed to serve as a deterrent, meaning that the sentence is unpleasant enough to make would-be criminals think twice about taking the risk. Prison is intended as punishment, vengeance, or retribution too; we expect criminals to pay society back for their wrongdoings, and taking away their freedom is one way to exact punishment. Incarceration is also a way to incapacitate those who commit crimes. The death penalty happens to be very effective at achieving all of these objectives, with the exception of rehabilitation. However, a life sentence is also a poor way to achieve this last goal since the inmate isn't expected to reenter society.",

However, rehabilitation sounds like a worthy goal: if only we could transform the worst criminals into decent citizens, what a wonderful world it would be! However, the reality of prison rehabilitation programs usually falls far short of any lofty plan. Such programs typically suffer from lack of funding and resources, along with low attendance rates. For those serving life sentences, the motivation to participate is mitigated by the reality that the prisoner is never going to rejoin society anyway. To counteract low participation rates, some prisons force \"lifers\" to enroll or face consequences such as being placed in solitary confinement or deprived of recreation. In some cases, prisoners are even subjected to questionable behavioral therapy with the supposed goal of rehabilitation but the actual intent of creating compliant inmates.",

However, who decided that it is more important to rehabilitate prisoners than to punish them? While our Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment, it does not endorse a blanket ban on any form of punishment. In fact, punishment serves a real purpose, because it tends to have more of a deterrent effect than rehabilitation. Punishment also serves as a way to restore justice and a sense of fairness when society or an innocent individual has been wronged by the action of another. Just as we punish a toddler for bad behavior in order to correct and deter the behavior, we should punish perpetrators of crime to prevent further crime. Thus, it is questionable whether rehabilitation rather than punishment should be the aim of prison and of the criminal justice system itself.",

Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is \u201cRehabilitation\u201d. The second point is \u201cWorld\u2019s trend\u201d. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that rehabilitation is a valid reason to adopt life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. However, rehabilitation fails in comparison with the death penalty at achieving what should be its primary objecting: reducing or eliminating repeat offending. While executing prisoners is completely effective in ensuring they never offend again, a life sentence can't give that guarantee. Even when the sentence is combined with the most carefully planned rehabilitation program, some prisoners will still commit crimes again, as long as they are alive. The reasons for this are complex, and include the very intertwined and often misunderstood roots of criminal behavior. But one thing is sure: capital punishment is an effective deterrent against future crimes committed by the involved criminal. Even if a life-sentenced prisoner never sees the light of day outside prison, he is still a threat to re-offend behind prison walls.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that rehabilitation, not execution, is the responsible option for those who commit the most serious crimes. However, like it or not, prisons have to operate within a budget. Taxpayers already complain about the high cost of keeping criminals behind bars. Thus, we need to prioritize where to invest taxpayer dollars in the criminal justice system to get the best return on our investment. Investing in costly rehab programs for the worst violent offenders who are supposed to be serving life terms seems foolhardy. Wouldn't it make more sense to spend that money on trying to rehabilitate first offenders and non-violent criminals, so they can succeed outside prison and have no desire or need to ever return to a life of crime? After all, these more minor offenders actually do have a chance of becoming contributing members of society and even taxpayers themselves.",

However, what is the point of rehabilitation if the intent is to keep someone locked up for life? Why spend a significant sum of money and use precious resources on training, counseling and reshaping the behavior of criminals who are never going to rejoin society anyway? Rehabilitation is more suitable for low-level crimes against property that carry relatively light sentences than for the kind of violent crimes against innocent citizens that would incur a death sentence -- or a life sentence, for that matter. A better use of that money and resources is to spend them in the community, in youth programs that target at risk youngsters who find an outlet in crime, instead of wasting them on unrepentant, hardened criminals.",

However, placing all the blame for criminal behavior on society is naive and fails to take into consideration the many diverse causes of crime. There are many risk factors for criminal behavior, and they are present in varied combinations in offenders. Some of these factors are more related to brain chemistry and other psychological issues than to societal pressures and circumstances. Other factors are engrained in society, including socio-economic disadvantages and the collapse of family structures. However, while we can feel smug about pointing the finger of blame at society, we shouldn't ignore the fact that criminals exercise free will when they choose to violate society's laws.

However, one problem that life imprisonment exacerbates and the death penalty solves is prison overcrowding. By freeing up prison space, prisoners are spared some of the attending problems of overcrowding, such as increased fighting and lack of oversight and a shortage of space for recreation. We often hear complaints about the inhumane circumstances prisoners are kept in. Yet, a life sentence would only extend the prisoner's time spent in those inhumane circumstances, instead of being an opportunity for real transformation. Being in prison for a long time tends to create hardened prisoners who can no longer function in society because they have become adapted to a life behind bars. Thus, life imprisonment represents the opposite of rehabilitation.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that we should try to rehabilitate even those who randomly kill many people. However, unfortunately, some people are probably beyond rehabilitation. Logically, the people most resistant to genuine rehabilitation are also probably the same people who commit heinous capital crimes, such as mass murderers and terrorists. Some of these people are true psychopaths or sociopaths who may be able to mimic \"normal\" behavior, and pretend that they are rehabilitated, just long enough to get released back into society. However, once they no longer have a motive to feign remorse and repentance, there is a real risk they will return to criminal behavior and perhaps even escalate their crimes, since they escaped the death penalty once. This is the type of scenario that capital punishment avoids. So, if keeping society safe from the most dangerous criminals is your goal, rehabilitation doesn't really fit as the strategy.",

    "pm_speech": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is \u201cRehabilitation\u201d. The second point is \u201cWorld\u2019s trend\u201d. So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that society creates criminals, so society has a burden to rehabilitate them. However, we don't fully understand what causes criminal behavior, making this argument flawed and making rehabilitation a risky prospect. We know that two people with the same experiences and backgrounds may turn out to be quite different in many respects, including their propensity to commit crimes. So, we cannot blame society for making people into criminals, and we cannot expect the criminal justice system to magically transform a criminal into a law-abiding citizen. The roots of criminal behavior are quite complex, and probably include socio-economic circumstances as well as personality type, parenting style, trauma, and even brain chemistry. Without knowing what makes one person turn to a life of crime and another stick to the straight and narrow path, it's practically impossible to know how to change the former into the latter.",

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today\u2019s motion. \u201cTo abolish\u201d means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. \u201cDeath penalty\u201d refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d The second point is \u201cRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.\u201d Let me explain the first point, \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone\u2019s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone\u2019s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to \u201cput an end to his own life,\u201d according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that restorative justice as an ideal form of justice; end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. However, one study says that, in Japan approximately 3 prisoners are hanged every year. That leads to reduction in crime rate in Japan. It is correct that, giving death penalty will create psychological fear to the persons those who are willing to commit such crimes in future. Such criminals are considered as predators in the society. There is no reason in arguing up-keeping such predators in the society. Try to understand the capital punishment is an act of justice and not an act of vengeance. It should be seemed as a consequence of disgraceful murderers. So I strongly support the death penalty.",

Reporting them is not an indication of a society becoming worse. This can be compared to crime not being reported or statistics not being published. News reports makes people aware of the danger out there and help them to take necessary caution in their lives. It could be in the form of getting better security or learning self-defence. It could also lead to people realising how badly crime could affect people and make them more law-abiding and gentle.",

But my point is now a days these cases are more disclosed and published in the media than before. Again \"Death penalty\" can not be kept on the same plane of 'Brutalization'. If one or both of the kidneys are damaged peoples are required to operate and cut off and replace the kidneys. Some times any human body part becomes infected by 'Cancer' and to save human life it is necessary to cut off that very part. These is very incidents known to all in our society and these can not be called as 'Brutalization'. When some people acts like 'Cancer' or the society considers one as a 'Cancer' to society it is necessary to cut off the part. So Death Penalty should not be abolished.",

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today\u2019s motion. \u201cTo abolish\u201d means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. \u201cDeath penalty\u201d refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d The second point is \u201cRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.\u201d Let me explain the first point, \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone\u2019s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone\u2019s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to \u201cput an end to his own life,\u201d according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone\u2019s life is an option, or a valid choice. However, taking someone's life can be a valid choice when it saves more lives or if it is for self-defence. A criminal might be way more dangerous and he might have put victims through very traumatic ordeal and causing them harm. If a state takes weak decisions, it might encourage the criminals that are willing to spend their lives in prison. This would be very bad for the society. Laws should be tough on crime, so the criminal would have a sense or fear and respect for the society.",

However, there is no evidence or statistical data to suggest that modern society is any more brutal today than in the past, and that the cause of this brutality is the death penalty.  It is true that there are instances where brutality occurs.  Such instances may involve cases of domestic violence or mass shootings in public places.  These cases are less common than the media portrays.  Furthermore, there has been no evidence put forth that the occurrence of such incidents are the direct result of the death penalty.  Domestic violence have a number of factors, as does mass shootings.  These factors may include economic standing, mental health issues, or drug abuse.  It would be incorrect to state that the death penalty increases the brutality of society because the act of killing someone is in itself brutal.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that the brutality of the death penalty itself causes increasing brutality in modern society, such as the murder of children by their parents. However, the death penalty stands as a shield against barbaric crimes rather than a tool of barbarism. Imposition of the death penalty is handled in a civilized manner, and the prisoner is given every opportunity to prove his innocence, including the automatic right of appeal. Only a unanimous jury of peers can hand down such a sentence after weighing the strongest evidence, so the death penalty represents a just and sound act, not a barbaric or random one. Furthermore, whether by lethal injection or other method, the modern death penalty is imposed in a manner that is intended to be final but not painful. Instead of brutalizing society, this ultimate punishment serves as a strong message that our society does not permit brutality against innocents.",

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today\u2019s motion. \u201cTo abolish\u201d means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. \u201cDeath penalty\u201d refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d The second point is \u201cRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.\u201d Let me explain the first point, \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone\u2019s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone\u2019s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to \u201cput an end to his own life,\u201d according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. However, there has always been crime even before governments implemented any kind of justice. Justice was established in order to enforce the laws that were enacted in order for society to function. The people who do not abide by these laws need to have repercussions for not following these laws. In the case of crimes against someone where their life is taken or where someone is harmed for life there needs to be a type of justice that not only punishes the criminal but deters those who would commit those crimes in the future. When we take away harsh punishment people are not as deterred. Government did not cause the crimes but it is because the government is too lax that the crimes are commited.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty brutalizes society due to the chance of wrongful conviction of an innocent person. However, there is little evidence to suggest that any truly innocent persons have been put to death in recent times -- at least since the beginning of the 20th century in the US. When capital punishment sentences are overturned on appeal, the typical result is conversion to a life sentence. Only in the rarest cases does an appeal result in a death penalty case being reversed, with the conviction tossed out. Furthermore, in such cases, the reason is typically a lack of overwhelming evidence or a legal technicality; for instance, juror or prosecutorial misconduct may be cited. In other words, winning an appeal doesn't mean the accused was actually innocent. In order to get a death sentence, a unanimous jury decision is needed, along with strong proof such as DNA evidence. Thus, wrongful convictions of the innocent are very rare in capital punishment cases in modern times.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that constant exposure to violent news media is causing society to become more brutal and violent. However, this argument about the news causing individuals to become more and more violent is false. One major counter argument would be the fact that violence existed among humans even before the invention of things like electronics. We have written documentation of things like crucifixion in the Bible and that is far more violent and upsetting than things we see on the news. If anything, past generations were even more violent and killed for things far more serious like religion.",

Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today\u2019s motion. \u201cTo abolish\u201d means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. \u201cDeath penalty\u201d refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d The second point is \u201cRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.\u201d Let me explain the first point, \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone\u2019s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone\u2019s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to \u201cput an end to his own life,\u201d according to a news report.

    "lo_speech": "They said that human life is too precious to allow the state to impose the death penalty. However, it is because human life is so precious that we must have the most severe punishment as an option for those who commit murder. If the death penalty prevents the murder of innocents by serving as a deterrent, it is warranted. Moreover, we know that released criminals sometimes go on to commit further crimes, including murder. This possibility is erased when the criminal is put to death. Even a life sentence doesn't provide 100 percent protection against the chance of a prisoner killing again, since his victims can be found within the prison walls in the form of a fellow inmate or a prison guard. There is always the slim chance of escape from prison, too. Thus, the death penalty helps protect precious lives -- lives arguably more precious than that of the person who committed the crime worthy of death.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished due to the chance that a criminal will kill in order to end his own life. However, the death penalty is imposed so rarely -- and so slowly -- that it hardly serves as an effective tool for the criminal bent on \"suicide by state\".  The sentence of death is handed down in a tiny fraction of court cases, requiring a unanimous jury verdict, an abundance of unquestionable evidence, and -- most significantly -- requiring the commission of the most heinous crime fitting the definition of a capital offense. After the verdict of death is rendered, a prisoner typically sits on death row for ten years or more. It isn't rare for a prisoner to await the death sentence for decades. Moreover, most cases involving a sentence of capital punishment result in conversion to a life sentence. Thus, unlike \"suicide by cop\" which does occur comparatively frequently and instantly, capital punishment isn't a practical way to achieve suicide by the state.",

However, this argument does not demonstrate a cause and effect relationship whereby capital punishment causes brutality in society, including brutal crimes such as the killing of children by their parents and random murderous sprees. Instead, brutal crimes \"cause\" capital punishment. The death sentence is only handed down when a crime fitting the definition of capital offense occurs, including mass murder. Moreover, the death sentence intends to reduce the commission of such brutal crimes by serving both as a deterrent against others committing such crimes and by permanently eradicating the source.

However, the small number of cases where a crime was committed with hopes of achieving the death penalty are statistically irrelevant in comparison to the overwhelming amount of crimes that are prevented because criminals fear the death penalty. With untrustworthy court and legal systems, criminals know that if they commit a serious crime, the death penalty may be on the table. If someone is serious about ending their own life, it's unlikely you'll be able to stop them. There are numerous other ways for them to complete that goal, with less effort, than committing a heinous crime, going through the court system, death row, and eventually being put to death.",

    "pm_speech": "Today\u2019s motion is \u201cWe should abolish the death penalty.\u201d We strongly believe that we should put an end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. Government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. Let me define today\u2019s motion. \u201cTo abolish\u201d means to stop the implementation of the practice of the death penalty and instead replace it with a life in prison with the possibility of parole. \u201cDeath penalty\u201d refers to the punishment currently applied to offenders of serious crimes, through which the criminal gets their life terminated by various methods including hanging, lethal injection, and electrocution. Now, let me explain our points. We have two points to make today. The first point is \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d The second point is \u201cRestorative justice as an ideal form of justice.\u201d Let me explain the first point, \u201cBrutalization of the society.\u201d Evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. We are constantly exposed to those kinds of news on various media including television, the Internet, and newspapers. In a sense, they are reflections of how brutal our society has become, and at the same time, they are causing the brutalization itself. We believe that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society for three reasons. Firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someone\u2019s life is an option, or a valid choice. Human life is more precious than anything else, and no one, including a nation state, should have the power to take it away. The second reason is prosecution by mistake. Actually, there are many cases of false charges like the Menda case. It could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. A wrongful conviction, especially when it comes to the death sentence, can never be justified. Data might imply that it's only one-in-a-thousand occurrence; however, that one-in-a-thousand is a huge deal because we are talking about someone\u2019s LIFE. The third reason is the intentional abuse of the system. There was a series of random killings committed by a man in Hokkaido in July 2016. Four people were killed as a result, and his motivation was to \u201cput an end to his own life,\u201d according to a news report. If a form of punishment becomes a motivation to commit a crime, it no longer functions as a punishment. If the heaviest punishment was a sentence to life in prison, then he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to kill those four precious lives. Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that the death penalty is subject to intentional abuse by those wishing to end their own life. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that those wishing to take their own life use the death penalty as a form of motivation to commit their crime.  In fact, those on death row fight extremely hard to reverse the death penalty imposed on them.  Inmates are afforded automatic appeals before their sentences are carried out.  Inmates have shown that they will pursue all of these measures until their appeals have run out.  They simply do not want to die when faced with the reality of it occurring.  Suicides are a more personal act.  Those who commit suicides are often alone, and will sometimes leave behind a message to their love ones to explain their act.  Suicides are personal because those who commit them do not want to involve others.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that homework doesn't fit into the student's busy schedule. However, in life, it is important to learn how to prioritize activities. Having a busy schedule is a fact of life for students, and being too busy to fit in every possible activity is something that continues into adulthood. That's why it's so important to figure out how to decide which activities matter most and deserve priority over less meaningful activities. It's pretty easy to see that homework is more important than playing video games or hanging out with friends at the mall, for instance, since homework is part of education. Thus, the student should put \"doing my homework\" at or near the top of the list when deciding how to allocate limited time.",

However, fitting activities into a frequently busy schedule is a life skill that homework helps teach and that proves useful beyond school. Learning how to make a schedule is a worthy lesson, and it is just one of the benefits of assigning homework. When a student gets a homework assignment, he has a few choices: create a schedule with a time slot for doing the homework, hope he remembers to do the work without creating a schedule, or ignore the assignment in favor of another way to spend time after class. When the latter methods fail and negative consequences (like a failing grade) result, the student eventually learns that the way to succeed is by making time for important tasks, and the best tool for doing that is a schedule.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that there is no time to do homework. However, this argument assumes that teachers are inflexible when it comes to homework deadlines. In fact, if a student has a legitimate reason for needing extra time for homework, most teachers will be reasonable enough to grant it. This argument also assumes that homework assignments are given on such short notice that it's impossible to get the work done while balancing other activities. In fact, most teachers recognize that kids participate in extra-curricular activities and encourage that participation. Consequently, it is rare for teachers to assign so much homework that it can't possibly be done while also having time for clubs and sports. Having enough time for homework is more a matter of learning how to juggle and balance activities than having to quit one in order to manage the other.",

These kids have hobbies like Scouting, volunteering at a pet rescue, or learning a new language. These kids spend their time taking piano lessons, playing chess online, and interacting with their parents and siblings. However, we know that real kids aren't perfect. The kind of things kids \"really want to do\" tend to include surfing questionable Internet sites, playing violent video games, and watching TV shows and movies that are not G-rated.

I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers\u2019 workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \u201cteacher\u201d who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that passove character is harmful to students because a school is not a place. However, it is not true in many cases. Many people rely on other guideline of their lives such as social norm, parent, friends, their role model and so on. For example, if some students are wondering what to do in the future, they will ask their surrounding people like parents or friends how they should do. Or student might imitate their role model\u2019s decision or social norms. Thus, many people rely on other guideline, so no matter how passive students are, it does not a matter. They will find other guideline of their lives. That\u2019s why their point is not true.",

I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers\u2019 workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \u201cteacher\u201d who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character. However, yes it might be true somehow. But it is not mutually exclusive in this debate. Even if there are no assignments forced by teacher, children are forced many passive choices. For example, student parents say that \u201cYou should study harder than now , so you must go to cram school.\u201d or \u201dyou should play piano because it might be helpful for your future.\u201d. These kind of parental oppression of child decision exit in their paradigm rather it will be stronger because parent need to instruct their child instead of the teacher. That\u2019s why I believe government side point is not mutually exclusive.",

We strongly believe that school should prioritize the quality of study rather than making student passive because academic background is more important than passive character. Currently, many business corporations often evaluate obedient people because corporations consisted by many stuffs and require spirit of cooperation. So, even if student are passive they can join such companies, if they have enough level of education. So we are concern that academic skills are much important than passive character.",

First, it is not true because we can manage ourselves even if there are homework. If they think about their academic ability seriously, they can do everything for example read another books, go to cram schools and so on. Therefore homework is not the obstruction of their independence. Second, that is not mutually exclusive. There are no proof that all students will think about themselves seriously. And I think students won't think because most of them think that \"I don't have to study.\"  Students are immature, so they will abandon study. Therefore, there are no connection between taking this motion and students  independence. And there are no contradiction because first I said about serious students. And second, I said about most of students. Even if some students can think seriously, there are no relationship between homework. As a result, both side their argument is not standing.",

In order to judge students\u2019 ability, teachers put on homework. Thus, students have to plan their schedule. For example, they have to calculate the time for homework. Furthermore, given homework, they can automatically notice their study ability. By those tendency, they improve their study plan. In those processes, teacher donot intervene each student. Therefore, even in current situation, students always manage what they need to do, and teachers are testing the management ability through homework.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that homework should be abolished since school is not a place where students only learn to study. However, studying remains a key purpose of school, if not THE key purpose. To say that we should do away with homework because students should be learning how to live instead is a recipe for disaster. We need to prepare students for the real world by giving them a foundation of basic skills. Homework is one way to reinforce these basic skills, including reading, writing and arithmetic. Too often today, we expect schools and teachers to fill roles unrelated to teaching -- expecting teachers to serve as nannies and nurses and counselors, instead of their vital role of passing on knowledge. Homework is still one of the best tools a teacher has to reinforce and extend what is taught in the classroom.",

In a real sense, homework straddles these two worlds by literally taking place after school, in preparation for what comes after graduation. Homework resembles and prepares students for the real world, where an authority figure like a teacher is typically not directly present -- in sight, and within easy reach. Nonetheless, that authority figure is still a force to be reckoned with for students, since failing to complete the assignment has repercussions like a failing grade. This is much like the real world, where the worker must have the initiative to do their work or suffer termination or demotion, even without a boss hovering over them.",

Rather, it will encourage the student to find and use outside resources in order to enlargen their educational sphere. If the student doesn't know how to do something or how to answer a question the student will have to find appropriate resources to find out how and the student will additionally have to understand how to use those resources. This is something that employers generally do like because it shows that the worker knows how to be independent and work on their own rather than relying on their supervisor for assistance as soon as any sort of challenge arises.",

I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers\u2019 workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \u201cteacher\u201d who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that students will not have a teacher once they graduate and will not be able to think about what they need to do by themselves. However, the teacher can pick and choose topics which foster independence. For example they can carry out independent research and write reports and then present them in class. This can help students to gain confidence in their abilities. This does not hinder independence, and rather helps students to gain confidence in their abilities. Students can learn new skills through the assignments which can help them to apply these skills to the classroom and to the real world.",

Therefore, homework should be abolished. However, the essence of homework is about the process. Students should be get more involved in homework. Start from the very beginning of homework, teachers should encourage students to participate the creation of homework and accommodate students\u2019 ideas and thoughts to create interesting homework together. Teachers\u2019 role in homework is to observe and encourage students whereas students are empowered to take initiates throughout every aspect of the homework process to deliver the results of learning. Teachers encourage students to brainstorm ideas, ask questions for clarification, and overcome difficulties. The process can be far outweighed the results, which develop proactive and independent growth mind-set that can be one of the biggest assets in their life. Therefore, homework should not be abolished.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that homework doesn't teach how to live. However, when it comes to learning real life skills, homework probably does a better job than in-class studying. For instance, homework today often involves the very real life skill of Googling, specifically, and learning how and where to find valid resources, generally. Resourcefulness is a key life skill that homework fosters. Because homework isn't done with teacher supervision, it requires students to follow basic directions and then troubleshoot solutions to difficulties encountered along the way. Moreover, because homework is done independently by students, it helps develop traits of resilience, creativity, critical thinking, and work ethic. Thus, homework helps students learn how to live in a world that is much bigger than the classroom and one that is filled with more and different challenges.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that forcing kids to do homework instills passivity, so homework should be abolished. However, this argument assumes that homework is always forced on students and that students have no say in whether to do the work. In fact, students always have the choice to do the homework or face the consequences of failing to do their work. This teaches students an important lesson that applies to the real world: that choices have consequences. Homework is actually an ideal tool to teach this lesson, since students make the choice without the domineering presence of their teacher. Furthermore, homework assignments are not necessarily \"forced\" on students. Wise teachers know that homework is more appealing when it includes freedom and options, such as a choice between writing a book report or designing a book cover. In this way, homework is not passive work forced on the student, but work that requires the student to take charge and make choices.",

However, homework, by its nature, actually requires students to work independently, more so than work done in the classroom. Once the assignment is given by the teacher, it is up to the student to do the work, which entails both preparation and execution. Having to do homework makes students less reliant on their teacher, because they have to figure out how to do the assignment, beyond the basic instructions and guidelines given by the teacher. In addition, teachers can -- and often do -- give creative homework assignments that require independent thinking and develop skills of research, insight and decision-making. Thus, homework is less of an obstacle to independent thinking than a tool that teaches it.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that students should study based on their curiosity. However, it is not a important point in this debate.\nThis is because they can study based on their curiosity even if they have some homework. For example, they can go to museums after finishing their homework during summer vacation. They can study their favorite subjects after finishing their homework. That's to say, they have some free time to study based on their curiosity even if they have some homework. That's the reason why we believe that even if studying based on curiosity is important thing, students can do that even without abolishing homework.",

This is because babies do not know what is good or bad. Therefore parents support by forcing. As same as children also do not know what is useful in the future.

However, elementary school students\u2019 curiosity is limited to narrow range because they do not experience various things. The training through homework can cultivate students\u2019 perspectives, values, and curiosities. If curiosity-based learning is only implemented, their curiosity is intensive, but their perspectives are not expanded. However, homework makes students experience various thing. The characteristic of elementary schools that give shallow and width information is applicable for the latter studying style. Therefore, primary school should not depend on children limited curiosities.   ",

We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That\u2019s how studying should be. It\u2019s not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That\u2019s one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that since some students dislike studying, we should do away with homework. However, rather than doing away with homework, we should try to figure out why some students are averse to studying, then figure out ways to combat that aversion. Avoiding the subject by abolishing homework doesn't get at the root of the problem. Perhaps students dislike studying because of a learning issue that needs to be addressed. Or, students may dislike studying because they can't see how it matters or they find the subject boring. Teachers can overcome these obstacles by assigning homework in the area of the student's interest and by creating homework assignments that are meaningful rather than mundane repetition. Finally, if the problem is simply that students dislike studying because it's work, teachers can create homework that doesn't seem like work, and they can use homework to teach students the value of doing their work by rewarding completed assignments.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that since some students don't like studying, it should be abolished. They shouldn't be obliged to study. However, this argument doesn't make much sense. Most students don't like going to school, but we shouldn't abolish school. Most kids don't like chores or taking baths, but we don't talk about abolishing cleaning. The fact is that homework has been a part of our school system forever and it shouldn't be changed now. If we give kids the option to not do homework, of course they won't do it. But that would mean that they lose out on opportunities to learn more. Homework drills the stuff into their heads. Without homework, kids would forget most of what they learn. That's why most schools give Summer assignments, because its been proven that kids forget tons of what they learned while on summer vacation.",

There are very few no. of brilliant and talented students who can memorize their lessons by just learning or listening once. But for most of the students to gain skill for a lesson, the only way is to practice. But for a teacher in a 40 to 60 min. session, it is impossible to teach and give practice of a lesson to a no. of students in a class.

The argument stated above even says it right at the beginning \"First: some students tend to dislike studying\" The prior argument wants me to believe that students that dislike studying will study on their own. I cannot follow the logic in that argument. I feel that in order to learn how to study a student must be given homework, so they can find value in finding the answer to a problem on their own. It also teaches them responsibility and how to manage their time better. I know that a lot of students enjoy homework, because it allows them to explore certain things to find answers and satisfies their natural curiosity for learning. Homework needs to be assigned to teach students responsibility and foster leaning.",

Possible compromises might be no homework for the weekends or holidays, one subject per night, or homgnework given every other day.\n Dosing assignments helps reinforce materials taught, and should be modified, not abolished.",

Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies.

    "lo_speech": "They said that students shouldn't be obligated to do homework because studying shouldn't be obliged. However, \"Obligation\" does not have to have a negative connotation. When homework is defined as obligatory in the sense that it is something forced upon a student, it's no wonder homework gets a bad rap. However, being obligated also means being responsible, fulfilling one's duty, and being committed. If we shift our perspective on homework from something that is forced upon students to something that students take responsibility for, that they fulfill and commit themselves to, the connotation of homework becomes positive. In this sense, homework is a still the duty of a student, but it doesn't have to be a begrudging one.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that it is not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers nd parents. However, that is exactly why homework is so important. Following rules and doing what authority figured tell you is a useful skill to have. Useful might be an understatement. It is an essential skill. It also leads to self discipline. If you are given a task, such as homework, being able to to do that task without further supervision is important and valuable. School is hand holding, while homework is freedom in a way. That freedom needs structure. Their argument also fails to mention that students who do poorly in school, won't suddenly do better if homework is abolished. They will fall further behind. Homework gives them a chance to catch up since they can take their time. They have not restricted to the time limit of a school day.",

It gets kids working harder at a younger age and being more focused at an early age which could lead to better things down the road as an adult as well.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that obliging students to do homework when they don't like studying is a bad thing. However, all of us have obligations, and the sooner kids learn that shirking obligations is a bad thing, the better. For instance, employees have an obligation to perform the jobs they are paid to do. Likewise, kids have an obligation to get out of bed in the morning to go to school. The obligation to do homework is just one of the many obligations that kids will encounter in life. Teaching kids that they don't have to do work because they dislike working is not a good idea. Fulfilling obligations can actually be rewarding as well. For instance, taking care of your pet is rewarding because it helps you bond with your pet. So, denying kids the rewards that come with carrying out obligations -- including homework -- is just unfair.",

However, students, and all children, need to learn to do things that they dislike as a way to get them acclimated to adult responsibility. Homework is just one of these things, and an important one, but if we were to abolish the effort, we'd soon be leaving students to nothing but play, and in fact we'd probably end up abolishing school entirely, because many students dislike it. There may be more effective teaching methods, but homework is a tried and true method for teaching children not only responsibility, but independence, by teaching them to work without adult guidance, which is absolutely essential to becoming an autonomous adult. So, homework teaches both independence, and responsibility to children, and the practice should be continued.",

We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \u201charmful efforts\u201d and the second point is \u201cdecreasing teacher\u2019s burden\u201d. Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I\u2019ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

In the first place, those students tend not to feel guilty to break the rule which is shown by their teachers. That is unfortunately obvious when we see their actions concerned with homework. They can commit such a bad way to do homework precisely because they don't think the rule of their school is so important. So we think that even if homework were abolished, for example, they will commit that during tests. That's the reason why their analysis is not so mutually exclusive.",

We believe that they can find it bad through being scold for such a bad behavior concerned with homework by their teachers and friends. However, if homework were abolished they will lose such an important opportunity for them. In that instance, they might commit that after graduating their school. For example, they might commit it when they have to finish their tasks in their cooperation. It is harmful for their future, rather than beneficial.",

However, government side hasn\u2019t explained how to teach students the way to properly study without any homework, or how to encourage students who have memorized the incorrect way to accomplish a correct way, thus even if we abolish homework, there is no guarantee that students will have proper way to study or reform their incorrect way to study. Therefore, what Prime Minister said is not the effective reason to abolish homework.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that students can learn the \"incorrect way\" to study with homework, so it should be abolished. However, there is no one right way to study, and saying one way to study is right and another is wrong is a subjective value judgment. Studying done in intervals of time, while riding the school bus or waiting for class to start or even while eating lunch is not without value, even if it is not ideal for all students. In this busy modern world, learning how to multi-task is actually a valuable lesson, and one that homework does a good job of teaching. Students can develop the ability to succeed at multi-tasking, for instance, by doing homework while listening to music, or by reciting vocabulary definitions while doing dishes.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that when students copy homework from their classmates, they learn nothing. However, while I'm not going to argue that copying another student's homework is the right thing to do, it's inaccurate to say that there is no opportunity for learning in this situation. In fact, students can learn a lot from the act of copying another person's work. The lessons are not just academic and applicable only to school, moreover, since they apply to how one lives life in general. When a student copies a classmate's homework, he faces several consequences, ranging from having a guilty conscience to getting caught and getting punished or getting a failing grade because the original work that was copied was not up to par. By suffering these consequences, a student learns valuable life lessons about the importance of making the right choices.",

Their main reason was not being pressed for time either. It was all about not wanting to put forth the effort. The students that are pressed for time with extracurricular activities will not benefit as much as you think. They will find other things to take up their time. Perhaps it will be some other club. So I\u2019m the end, you\u2019re not rewarding students with more time to concentrate or better studying behavior.

However, you could apply this same logic to test taking: students who copy test answers from their neighbor can pass a test without understanding the material. But not many people would argue that this is a valid reason to do away with testing. In fact, you could argue that this is a good teaching opportunity for learning about ethics and the consequences of one's choices. Students who copy answers on tests and homework run the risk of copying bad work as well as the risk of getting caught and facing repercussions like failure or expulsion. Students also learn, over time, that copying work is counter to actually studying and learning the material. Abolishing testing or homework deprives students of the chance to learn this.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that students learn a right way and wrong way to study from having homework that they copy off other students/. However, for this argument, I would like to ask what is a right way to study? Is course work in general not just memorizing work? There is no wrong way to study, people learn in different speeds and in different ways. In fact, copying the homework could lead to a better understanding due to having to write out the answer. Repetition is usually a good learning technique. Some people learn faster than others and who is to say that students that are copying work aren't the ones who understand the work and are okay with just copying it? The point is also flawed since copying homework will not effect the class as much as passing a test. If a student does copy homework, but aces the test, they understand the material and understand how to study.",

However, I understand the burden of trying to fit in hobbies, club activities, jobs, normal school-work, and homework on top of that. However, this is a case of time management. While there are teachers that assign too much or too little homework - this will prepare you for the real world. There are going to be times in your full time job in the future where your boss gives you very little to do and it will be easy to manage. However, there will be times where you have projects come up last minute - ones you need to put many extra hours into. You will be dealing with things like a marriage, a house, kids, etc. If you learn how to manage your time in high school and these extra projects, it's going to prepare you for the real world.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that we should do away with homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. However, the fact is, the kind of studying that works for one student or that works in one situation isn't necessarily right -- or wrong -- for another student or for another situation. Through trial and error, students learn the kind of studying that works for them. Homework is a great tool for this, since it is practiced frequently and since it has consequences that are both direct -- such as a passing grade -- and indirect -- such as succeeding at learning the material and applying it later on. Assigning homework regularly gives students many opportunities to figure out what kind of studying works best for them, whether that means practicing spelling words while showering and getting ready for school or skipping TV watching to devote full attention to writing a book report.",

However, abolishing homework because some students cheat is unwise because it ends up depriving all students of the academic and other benefits of homework because of the bad choices of some. Moreover, students who cheat by plagiarizing work need to learn a lesson. Simply doing away with homework deprives these students of the chance to learn that lesson and actually rewards them for cheating. In addition, it is a bit naive to think that teachers can't discern when students have copied their work from a classmate or other source.

    "pm_speech": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \u201charmful efforts\u201d and the second point is \u201cdecreasing teacher\u2019s burden\u201d. Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I\u2019ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that homework is harmful because it encourages bad study habits by kids too busy to do it. However, the arguments made are not entirely invalid. Obviously, kids today have busy schedules and it's tempting to 'cheat' or cut corners when it comes to homework. But, the solution isn't doing away with homework, since homework serves a valuable purpose by reinforcing classroom lessons. A better solution is to get more creative with homework. Teachers can give homework assignments that better fit into their students' busy modern lives. For instance, homework assignments can incorporate some activities that already occupy after-school schedules. Creative homework ideas include plotting a story based on video game play, or applying chemistry principles to preparing a meal for the family. Moreover, these kind of assignments can't be copied from another student.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that elementary school students can\u2019t finish homework by themselves. However, this is completely not true. Even elementary school students can finish their homework by themselves. Elementary school is a place really primitive knowledges such as writing letters, constructing sentences, reading, counting numbers, calculation, and so on. Furthermore, how to do these things are usually learn in school. Primary students just need to repeat what they have done in their daily lessons. In fact, my brother and sister can finish their homework by themselves. So, I am sure that primary student can finish their homework by themselves.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that homework needs help from the students parents and its not good. However, it won't be a sufficient reason to abolish homework. If homework needs help from parents, the teacher can do something for the students. For example, they can hold office hours, they can write a comment on the homework, they can explain the difficult part in the class and they can distribute the explanation sheet afterward. There are many alternative ways to solve this problem and it's enough. Homework gave from high school is too difficult for parents to help, but there are no big problems. Therefore, their argument doesn't stand.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that abolishing homework and teaching only in school is more efficient. However, they haven't explained why studying without homework is more efficient. We strongly believe that homework is an efficient way to pursue academic ability. In school, there are many students, and support from teachers tends to be insufficient. Moreover, there is time restriction and students cannot think at their own pace. They tend to be required to catch up with other students. On the other hand, studying at home has no time restrictions and they can research books or the internet about their question as much as they want. There is a lot of You-tube video that teaches you studying. It helps students with a good understanding of the class. And homework provides a good chance to study at home which is very helpful as I explained. Therefore, we should not abolish homework.",

For example, children cannot go to private school or cram school to seek more suitable condition of education. Moreover, some of them need to help home care work like cooking, cleaning and so on.

However, students can notice other points at the same time. Like that, homework is not just for study, but also for learn how to live. Therefore, homework should not be abolished.",

That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the \u201cresponsibility of schools\u201d and the second point is \u201cincreasing creativity\u201d. The first point \u201cresponsibility of schools\u201d means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society.

    "lo_speech": "They said that responsibility of schools. However, it's not true. Because, doing homework, on the other hand, can make the school's responsibilities less onerous.Because doing homework can measure the overall academic performance of the school and other things.However, if you abolish it, it becomes very difficult to do it, and schools should keep homework because they feel responsible for it. From this case, taking homework is essentially need for students. On this reason I think Homework shouldn't be abolish.",

They tried to say that \"when children face some difficulty on their homework, they have to rely on their parents.\" However, that assumption is not correct. If they hope, they can access to free education systems. For example, there are many NPOs which provide the free education. Even if their countries don't have it, they can ask teachers the questions. That's to say, parents are not only actor who can help their children. such an unfair situation is minimized by free education systems.

However, it is unfair and wrong to play the onus of teaching children solely on the shoulders of the school system. Parents should be responsible for teaching their children. To say that \"all necessary and important lessons\" must be learned from school is preposterous at best. Parents teach lessons about real world situations and responsibilities such as money management, cooking, self-care, and the proper way to handle oneself in society. Parents must share in the responsibility for teaching these real world skills along with knowledge. If there is no reinforcement of learning at home and when interacting with the world at large, the learning at school become isolated and meaningless.

Students are supposed to be taught and provided every resource they need to complete their homework with or without family's help.

Running through a few problems at home and then going over the work the next day in class is less stressful on the students. Further, there are some skills that improve with repetition; the more one does multiplications, for example, the better one gets at them. Doing this repetition at home is an efficient use of time since it won't cut into class time.",

    "pm_speech": "Hello everyone. Today\u2019s motion is \u201cHomework should be abolished\u201d. We argue that all elementary schools should abolish homework because we believe that it is the responsibility of \u201cschools\u201d not \u201chome\u201d to teach all the necessary and important lessons, including academic content, to students. That is the perspective from the government. Let me explain our two points: The first point is the \u201cresponsibility of schools\u201d and the second point is \u201cincreasing creativity\u201d. The first point \u201cresponsibility of schools\u201d means we believe that the role of schools is to teach children the basic skills to live in society. For example, elementary school kids should be taught how to write letters, construct sentences, read, count numbers, calculate, and so on. Homework is study that is done at home. Of course, we don\u2019t deny the importance of voluntary study at home, but that should not be forced by schools. In many cases, elementary school students can\u2019t finish homework by themselves, so guidance from their parents is necessary. If you see these situations, you can easily understand that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. Therefore, schools should take responsibility for children\u2019s academic skills in the first place. What we should do in precious, limited time is to study in a manner that is meaningful. And studying meaningfully should be done \u201cat school\u201d for fairness and effectiveness. That\u2019s why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
    "lo_speech": "They said that elementary school students should learn all they need to know to function in society at school and that homework should not be mandatory because some children do not have two parents or parents who are willing or able to help them with it. However, in order for students to really grasp what is being taught to them in schools, homework is a necessity. People of all ages tend to forget things they learn right after they learn them. If children aren't made to go home and use what they learned to complete the homework, they won't be able to remember as much, which would make the work at school useless. Completing more work at home helps to ensure that what they learned will stay in their heads and not just be instantly forgotten. Sure, there is going to be a gap between kids who have helpful parents and kids who do not, but that's a fact of life for everything, not just homework. This doesn't mean homework is not helpful or should be abolished.",

    "lo_speech": "They said that homework should be abolished because teaching is the responsibility of schools. However, homework gives students a sense of ownership of learning. By assigning homework, teachers are giving a lesson in responsibility, a vital skill in every aspect of life. When students take responsibility for completing homework assignments in an environment lacking the rigid oversight of the classroom, they gain independence and self-discipline. Moreover, parents should actually play a minor role in homework, so kids without available parents to assist in homework are not penalized. That is because the ideal homework assignment draws on the foundational skills taught in class and encourages kids themselves to apply what they have learned, which reinforces learning and makes students the proud owners of their education.",
